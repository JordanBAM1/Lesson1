## What You'll Learn 📚  
- **Python Basics**: Understand simple Python concepts like print statements, variables, data types, and using python libraries (e.g., Streamlit!).  
- **Streamlit Basics**: Learn how to create interactive web apps with Streamlit.  
   
## Getting Started 🚦  
   
### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment  
1. **Open GitHub Codespaces**: Navigate to the repository and open it in GitHub Codespaces.  
2. **Run the App**: Start the Streamlit app by running the following command in the terminal: 
   ```bash  
   streamlit run app.py
   ```  

### Step 2: Create Your First Streamlit App  
Follow these steps to create a simple Streamlit app:  
   
1. **Open a New Python Script**: Create a new Python script called `hello_world.py`.  
2. **Enter the Following Code**:  
   ```python  
   import streamlit as st  #👈 the streamlit library is imported and aliased as st
  
   st.title("Hello World! 🌍")  
   st.header("This is a header")  
   st.write("Welcome to your first Streamlit app. 🎉")  
   ```  
3. **Run Your App**: Save your script and run the app using the command:  
   ```bash  
   streamlit run hello_world.py  
   ```  
   
### Step 3: Enhance Your App  
Try adding some interactive features to your app:  
   
- **Add a Subheader**:  
  ```python  
  st.subheader("This is a subheader")  
  ```  
- **User Input**:  
  ```python  
  name = st.text_input("Enter your name:")  
  st.write(f"Hello, {name}!")  
  ```  
- **Date Input**:  
  ```python  
  from datetime import datetime  
  date = st.date_input("Choose a date", datetime.now())  
  st.write(f"The selected date is {date}")  
  ```  
   
## Homework Assignment 📋  
Create a multi-page Streamlit app with the following sections:  
1. **About Me**: Introduce yourself.  
2. **Favorite Animals**: Display a list of your favorite animals with images.  
3. **My Hobbies**: Describe your hobbies and use interactive elements.  
4. **Fun Facts**: Share fun facts about yourself using columns and layout features.
